          Support for new [driver `remote`](/build/buildx/drivers/remote/) that you
          can use to connect to any already running BuildKit instance

          You can now load Dockerfile from standard input even when the build
          context is coming from external Git or HTTP URL

          Build commands now support the new build context type `oci-layout://` for
          loading build context from local OCI layout directories](/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#-source-image-from-oci-layout-directory).
          Note that this feature depends on an unreleased BuildKit feature and
          builder instance from `moby/buildkit:master` needs to be used until
          BuildKit v0.11 is released
        issues:

          You can now use the new `--print` flag to run helper functions supported
          by the BuildKit frontend performing the build and print their results.
          You can use this feature in Dockerfile to show the build arguments
          and secrets that the current build supports with `--print=outline`
          and list all available Dockerfile stages with `--print=targets`.
          This feature is experimental for gathering early feedback and
          requires enabling `BUILDX_EXPERIMENTAL=1` environment variable. We
          plan to update/extend this feature in the future without keeping
          backward compatibility

          You can now use the new `--invoke` flag to launch interactive containers
          from build results for an iterative debugging cycle. You can reload these
          containers with code changes or restore them to an initial state from
          the special monitor mode. This feature is experimental for gathering
          early feedback and requires enabling `BUILDX_EXPERIMENTAL=1`
